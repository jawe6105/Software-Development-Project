Description of ER Diagram:

Three data tables, one representing a user and his/her login information, one representing the user's data,
and the last one is a database with every job that has ever been posted. The ID in the login table is a primary key, and 
the ID in the user data table is a foreign key for it, and a primary key for itself. The username in the user data table 
is a foreign key for the username in the login table. The job ID is a primary key for its table. The claimed by is a foreign 
key for the jobs taken on the user data table.
